An Air-Quality-Sensor integrating a SEN55 particle sensor with a S88LP C02 sensor. IOT integration with Zigbee.

This project was developed to better understand and improve indoor air quality. Key indicators such as temperature, humidity, particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), VOCs, NOx, and CO₂ were identified as essential for both health and comfort. Poor air quality can trigger allergies, for example from dust mites, and directly impact well-being and productivity. In particular, CO₂ concentration is closely linked to our ability to concentrate — a critical factor in work and learning environments. By monitoring these values in real time, the system provides insights that help create healthier, safer, and more focused living and working spaces.
