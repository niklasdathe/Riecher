This project was developed to better understand and improve indoor air quality. Key indicators such as temperature, humidity, particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), VOCs, NOx, and CO₂ were identified as essential for both health and comfort. Poor air quality can trigger allergies, for example from dust mites, and directly impact well-being and productivity. In particular, CO₂ concentration is closely linked to our ability to concentrate — a critical factor in work and learning environments. By monitoring these values in real time, the system provides insights that help create healthier, safer, and more focused living and working spaces.
